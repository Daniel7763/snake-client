# Snake Client Project

Have you ever dreamed to embody a reptilian serpent slithering through a vast void? Well no more will you need to tire your arms flipping your giant hour glass, instead tire your fingers with SNEK! The second coming of SNAKE brings the bounty of multiplayer! Gone are the days of pondering your orb in solitude, instead ponder the SNEK with your mystic colleagues.  Announce your presence with three letters and express yourself with cryptic messages, such as... "Ye boi" and "Munch". The only rules are...
1. Thy head of SNEK shall not touch the walls of its flask or its tail.
2. Consume the treasures found within and you will be rewarded.
3. Thou shall not speak of SNEK.


Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
